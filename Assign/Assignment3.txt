Dalvik Virtual Machine Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------
1.
	a)Instruction Name: Moves the content of vy into vx. Both registers must be in the first 256 register range.
	
	b)Syntax: move vx,vy
	
	c)Example: 0110 - move v0, v1
			   Moves v1 into v0.
			   
			  
2.
	a)Instruction Name: Return with vx return value
	
	b)Syntax: return vx
	
	c)Example: 0F00 - return v0
			   Returns with return value in v0.
			   
			   
3.
	a)Instruction Name: Instantiates an object type and puts the reference of the newly created instance into vx.
	
	b)Syntax: new-instance vx,type
	
	c)Example: 2200 1500 - new-instance v0, java.io.FileInputStream // type@0015
               Instantiates type@0015 (entry #15H in the type table) and puts its reference into v0.
			   
			   
4.
	a)Instruction Name: Throws an exception object. The reference of the exception object is in vx
	
	b)Syntax: throw vx
	
	c)Example: 2700 - throw v0
			   Throws an exception. The exception object reference is in v0.
			   
			   
5.
	a)Instruction Name: Unconditional jump by short offset.
	
	b)Syntax: goto target
	
	c)Example: 28F0 - goto 0005 // -0010
			   Jumps to current position-16 words (hex 10). 0005 is the label of the target instruction.

Example for an application simulating context-aware computing:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Application Name: WiFi Chat , an Android mobile application.

Justification:  Wi-Fi proximity is the main idea behind Wi-Fi chat. If two users can see the same Wi-Fi access point (Wi-Fi network) then it is very
                probable that both can see each other. In other words, it is very likely that both are close to each other. Close in the geographical sense, of course.So, WiFiChat lets them create discussions (forums) as well as live web chats associated with Wi-Fi access points.
